# Abstract

This study proposes and validates an automated academic paper typesetting system based on Markdown-to-LaTeX conversion, aiming to significantly enhance the efficiency of scientific document authoring and the quality of typesetting. Addressing common pain points in traditional Word documents regarding format control, table of contents generation, formula alignment, and figure/table insertion, this system allows users to focus solely on writing plain text content, while delegating complex typesetting tasks to automated processes. We constructed a virtual paper with a complete and content-neutral structure as a test case. The system successfully implemented core functionalities such as rendering Chinese and English abstracts , automatic table of contents generation , insertion of images  and three-line tables , bibliography citation (BibTeX) , custom chapter management , and automatic PDF bookmark generation. Experimental results indicate that the system demonstrates good consistency and robustness when handling various document structures and style settings, effectively resolving numerous challenges in manual typesetting. Future work will focus on expanding the system's cross-platform compatibility and multi-template adaptability
